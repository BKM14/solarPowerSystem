# Solar Power System Sizing Tool

This C program is designed to assist users in determining the requirements for setting up a solar power system. 
By inputting appliance details and system configuration parameters, users can calculate the necessary components 
such as solar panels, batteries, charge controllers, and inverters.

## Features
- **Input Appliance Details**: Users can input details of appliances including name, rated power, quantity, and usage hours.
- **Display Appliance Details**: The program displays a summary of entered appliances along with their total wattage and consumption.
- **Input System Configuration**: Users can input various system configuration parameters such as battery efficiency, charge controller efficiency, and more.
- **Power Demand Calculation**: Calculates the total power demand from the solar array based on daily consumption and system efficiency.
- **Series-Parallel Configuration**: Determines the number of modules needed in series and parallel to meet system requirements.
- **Battery Bank Sizing**: Calculates the size of the battery bank needed based on daily consumption and autonomy days.
- **Charge Controller Sizing**: Determines the capacity of the charge controller required based on system configuration.
- **Inverter Sizing**: Calculates the capacity of the inverter required to handle the load.
